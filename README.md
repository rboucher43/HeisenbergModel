# HeisenbergModel

This class implements the Monte Carlo simualtions of the spin-1/2 magnetic systems 
including the Heisenberg model and the Ising model.


The heisenbergModel.py file contains all implementation of the two models.
The methods contained in heisenbergModel.py create the desired lattice, 
calculate total initial energy of the system, calculate the change in energy 
of the system as spins are flipped, plot the monte carlo distribution, and 
create a three-dimensional visualization of the ground state lattice.
